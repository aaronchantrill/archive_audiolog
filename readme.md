# Archive Audiolog - Speech to Text Trainer

Allows the user to export their audiolog database and audio files into an archive file that can be merged into a different Naomi using the Import Audiolog plugin. This provides a much more convenient package for storing or transporting audiolog recordings and transcriptions.
